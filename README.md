# 🗨 What is Legesher?

[Legesher](https://github.com/legesher) empowers developers to code in the context of their native language.&#x20;

Legesher, an open-source, native language-based programming platform, creates new opportunities for developers around the world to learn, create and collaborate. Designed to seamlessly integrate into a developer's current workflow, innovation won't be lost in translation.&#x20;

> ****:computer: **Legesher is currently in beta**. Development is focused on implementing a native-language enabled Python programming language and IDE.&#x20;
>
> ****:woman\_technologist: **Legesher is also contributor-driven.  **It relies on the passionate members of its community (both developer and non-developer alike) to keep delivering impactful tools to people all over the world.&#x20;

## Background

Computer Science, as a global discipline, is predominantly English-based. However, **only \~4%** of people in the world are native English speakers. Legesher creates access for non-native English-speaking developers to code using popular programming languages in the context of their native language. Legesher's open-source, native language-based programming platform is designed to bridge language barriers for education, innovation, and collaboration.&#x20;

## Introduction

This documentation guide is to serve beginners who are learning how to code 💻, developers who are using Legesher to program their projects 👩💻 , and any individual (whether tech-savvy or not) who wants to share their creativity 🎨 and innovation 💡 with this project to propel it forward 🎁.

There are many elements that makeup Legesher's programming platform. Instructions and tutorials on how to use and contribute are included in this documentation.&#x20;
